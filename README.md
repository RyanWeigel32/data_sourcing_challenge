For this project, we were required to access two different databases for movie-related data via API's. 

Following the API guidelines for each database, we filtered our search queries to pull specific movie data in JSON format based on set paramaters within a given time-window, and store them in list and dictionaries that would later be turned into their own separate DataFrames. 

Once both dataframes were set, we merged the data together through the 'title' column of each, cleaned the data, and saved it to a csv file.
